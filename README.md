Overview
This React component creates a responsive analytics dashboard displaying visitor statistics, charts, and metrics. It uses mock data for demonstration. The dashboard includes animated counters, charts (line, pie, bar), and interactive period selection (today/week/month/year). It simulates loading states and uses simple SVG-based icons and charts without external libraries like Chart.js.
I'll explain the code step by step, breaking it down by sections: imports, icons, individual components, mock data, and the main AnalyticsDashboard component.
